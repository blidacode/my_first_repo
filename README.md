# This is my first Python program simulating a basic ATM system. 
## The code allows users to perform essential banking operations like checking account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing funds. 
## It uses conditional statements to handle different user inputs and ensures basic error handling, such as checking if the withdrawal amount exceeds the balance. The program demonstrates my initial understanding of Python syntax, input/output operations, and logic building in programming."
